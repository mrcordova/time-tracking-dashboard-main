## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with css grid and flexbox together. I also learned how to have multiple hover effects on a parent and child element.

### Continued development

I will like to continue to learn about CSS Grid and how to make it more responsive.
